Session: [Driving Agile Networks In The Cloud Era](https://www.brighttalk.com/webinar/driving-agile-networks-in-the-cloud-era/)

Effectively automating infrastructure today is no longer a luxury but a staple in the enterprise move through future transformation. The place where applications, data, and systems intersect is the network, and the future network must be delivered consistently, reliably, and at scale. Innovation in the public cloud heralds a whole new approach for delivering immutable networking at scale, and modern network solutions make it possible to harness these approaches across your entire network.

This discussion will explore the following areas:
- Causal explanation of why network design today makes automation across core, edge, and cloud challenging
- Identify the specific attributes in public cloud that enabled agility for compute and application delivery, and explore applying them to the whole domain of networking
- Examine the benefits of leveraging Continuous Integration + Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) as a vehicle for building and managing fully immutable network infrastructure
